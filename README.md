# AFossil - archived source

In 2002 I was in the rather unique situation of needing to
support communications from a 16-bit dos applications under (at the time)
fairly modern Windows NT builds.  The application ran
fine under NTVDM, but serial communication didn't work reliably.

I had originally built the application to use the FOSSIL standard
for serial communications when running under plain DOS, since that was
my experience base (having grown up with Fidonet based bulletin boards, where the use
of this standard was common-place)

To solve this problem I built a DOS-fossil for Windows NT.
At the time I shared this with some others in the BBS community as a public
domain release but I've been unable to find any other archive of this.

Recent interest in the ex-fidonet community with reviving old DOS
software gives me reason to publish this again

This release contains the DOS TSR source code (AFOSSIL.8) which
would have been assembled using A86 (also included).

The Windows DLL would have been built with Visual C++; I have included
the source and latest build in its entirety
